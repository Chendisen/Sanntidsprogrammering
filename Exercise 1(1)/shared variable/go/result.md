3: GOMAXPROCS seems to decide how many "threads" that can be operated at the same time. So when we initialize it with 1, it is only able to run one thread at a time, removing the problems with race condition. When sharing the variable poorly, there will appear race conditions, so that both functions receive the variable with the same initial value at a given iteration of the loop, but the last function to send back their result will overwrite the other functions result.
